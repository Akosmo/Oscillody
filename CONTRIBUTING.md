# Contributing
- - -
Thank you for your interest in contributing! However, I'm not accepting any code contributions, at least for now. Instead, you'll find here how to report bugs and make suggestions.

## Before opening an issue
- - -
Make sure the bug you want to report, or your suggestion, isn't already an opened issue. You can add to that issue instead of opening a new one.
Also make sure you're using the latest version.

## How to report a bug
- - -
When reporting a bug, make sure:
- That it isn't already mentioned on README
- To include log file (and mention the relevant timestamp if there's one)
- To mention your computer specs, most importantly your system resolution, GPU, audio devices, OS, and drivers
- To include a screenshot or preferably a video if possible
- To include a video output or audio file imported if necessary
- To include steps to reproduce if you can

## How to make suggestions
- - -
These suggestions can be about new features or improvements. Don't forget to include the "enhancement" label on your issue.
When making a suggestion, make sure:
- That it fits the scope of this app (for example, don't suggest video editing capabilities or fully customizable particle system), but you can err on the side that your suggestion fits the scope
- To describe the current and wanted behaviors, if the suggestion is an improvement
